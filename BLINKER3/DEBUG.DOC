  Turbo Debugger support in real mode
  -----------------------------------

  Blinker support for Turbo debugger currently consists of real mode
  programs, displaying module source code with line numbers, public data
  symbols and non-overlaid public code symbols. We do not currently
  support overlaid code under the Turbo Debugger, but plan to in a
  subsequent release. TDCONVRT handles non-overlaid programs fine.

  If a program contains C or ASM overlays then the -c option must be
  used to create an external .TDS file, otherwise a Blinker 1203 error
  will occur at run time. This is because TDCONVRT places the debugging
  information directly after the root of the .EXE file. It also creates
  unusually large .TDS files with overlaid programs due to some internal
  confusion, but they appear to function correctly for the root part of
  the program.

  Overlaid programs will otherwise run correctly, but breakpoints on
  overlaid code will be ignored and display meaningless code at the
  symbol addresses.

  Turbo Debugger does not currently recognise the _main symbol as output
  from Blinker and TDCONVRT, so when running a program under the
  debugger select GOTO (Ctl G) and enter "main" to locate the start of
  the program.
