HOW TO USE

   The device can be opened as a file handle in any program languages that
   support this feature. Following is a sample C progam:


     FILE *fp;

       fp = fopen("VFD$$", "wb");             /* Open VFD       */
       fprintf(fp, "%c", 0);                /* init the VFD   */
       fflush(fp);
       fclose(fp);

   For simple usage, declare a 1x9 matrix that contain the characters to
   be displayed, and write to VFD. Hence, scrolling, and some other effects.
   can be achieved by manipulating the matrix.


COMMAND

    00h - To reset the VFD
    01h - To clear screen
    1xh - Set cursor to position x, where x is in the range 0 to 8.

    \r  - Carriage Return, set cursor =0
    \n  - Line feed, set cursor =0, clear screen
    \f  - Form feed, cursor postion unchanged, clear screen
    \b  - Backspace

    '.' - Display dot
    ',' - Display comma
    ';' - Display semi-colan
    'ซ' - Display 1/2 sign

    '!' - Toggle LED 1 on/off
    '@' - Toggle LED 2 on/off
    '#' - Toggle LED 3 on/off

    The rest are will be treated as characters to be displayed on the VFD.
    Note that the character to be displayed will be equal to its ASCII code
    value. For example to display 'A', just send 65 to VFD, which is the ASCII
    value of 'A'.
